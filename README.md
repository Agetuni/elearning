**[e-learning ]**  Ethiopian Aviation academy's e-learning system allows students to access course materials and complete assignments at their own pace, on their own schedule. This is particularly beneficial for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas. Another benefit of this system is that it is more cost effective than traditional classroom-based learning. It does not require physical classrooms, textbooks, or other materials, which can significantly reduce costs. Additionally, e-learning systems often offer a wider range of courses than traditional classroom-based learning, which can also help to reduce costs.
